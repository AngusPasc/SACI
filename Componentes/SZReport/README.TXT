ZReport (для Delphi 3.0) - 
VCL for text reports.


Hi!

Here you are with ZReport (Delphi 3, Delphi4) - 
almost complete analog of QuickReport, except 
that it is developed to design text reports.
I needed it because we have to produce a lot of
reports for matrix printers on the one hand
and we want to develop our report visually
and with no exporting QuickReport reports
to text format.

Beg your pardon: I'm too short of time to
document my library (VCL development is not my
direct job), so I hope that you can deal with it
yourself as soon as the idea of ZReport is much
close to QuickReport (QuickReport 2.0i was used
as an example). Don't claim me in stealing ideas:
both the functionality and the hierarchy of the
components are completely changed and now have
not so much common features with QR.

The suggested version is incomplete yet and contains bugs
(show me smth with no bugs). I'm not sure I'll be able
to correct them quickly but still I'd like you to
inform me about them.


------------------------------------------------------
At the moment I`m developing v2.0. 
The things already done are as follows:
- printing thru Windows spooler (not thru LPTx but thru standard
  printer drivers installed in the system yet keeping text mode);
- enhanced expression parser/evaluator;
- improved label autosizing, aligning, text wrapping etc.
- band / group designer.
The really actual thing is cross-tabs. Under development right now.

!!!!! Important !!!!!
I`m afraid this version is going to be incompatible with the 
previous one as soon as the ideology is significantly different.

I'm ready to cooperate with everyone who is interested in 
further developing of this library.

I`ll highly appriciate any ideas and extracts of code.
